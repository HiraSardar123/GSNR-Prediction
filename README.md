# GSNR-Prediction Repository

Welcome to the GSNR-Prediction repository! This repository contains a collection of real-world projects focused on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase practical applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques across diverse domains. Each project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in implementing algorithms, handling datasets, and evaluating model performance.
Each project implements GSNR prediction on European and USA datasets using various machine and deep learning techniques.

## Structure

Each project folder is organized with the following structure:

```
/Project_Name
    |-- code/                # Python scripts or notebooks for implementation
    |-- report/              # Detailed report summarizing project methodology and results
```

## How to Use

1. **Browse Projects:** Explore project folders to view detailed descriptions, code implementations, datasets, and reports.
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine to access project files and run scripts locally.
3. **Contribute:** Feel free to contribute by adding new projects, improving existing implementations, or providing feedback on reports.
